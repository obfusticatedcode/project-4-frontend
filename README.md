### Installation and setup

#### Description

Creating an open space where you can share some of the features you'd like to see in your favourite products. A voting system allows features with most votes to be at the top and the least votes at the bottom.
I used AngularJS on the front end and Ruby on Rails in the backend. PostgreSQL was a great fit to create models and relationships. To secure the app, I used oauth from Facebook, Github and Instagram to allow the UX to be easy and quick.
For image upload and storage I used AWS and Carrierwave.

#### Challenges faced

Using the AngularJS and Rails stack was challenging at first. Specifically the number of files was intimidating and have to remember when and where to use JS and Ruby.

To overcome this, I focused on the backend using the API only rails app. Then when the API was ready for consumption I started with the frontend. Planning is always key.



#### Conclusion
Going forward, I'd like to implement the following:

1. Have a natural language IBM Watson API read the sentiment of the users posts and tell product owners the users moods.
2. Have AI and allow the computer to make clever suggestions based on what the user likes.
